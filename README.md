# 📘 ERP Module – Course Registration Platform

This project began as part of our **IC-202P** course, where we were tasked with developing a comprehensive web platform for our college students with features to manage **course pre-registration**, **final registration**, **view results**, **access course information**, and **stay updated with academic events via a calendar**.

Having experienced firsthand the challenges students face with our current systems—shifting from **OAS** to **Samarth**, and at times even relying on **Google Forms**—we recognized the need for a more stable, streamlined, and college-specific solution.

Under the guidance of the **AD (Courses)**, we implemented features tailored to our institute's specific needs. Our team collaborated closely, dividing responsibilities effectively. **My primary focus was on developing the course pre-registration and final registration modules.**

We submitted our initial prototype, which has since been handed over to a dedicated team for further refinement. The enhanced version is planned to be tested for use in the upcoming semester. **This repository is just my contribution to the project.**
